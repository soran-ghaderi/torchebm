# Custom Neural Network Energy Functions

This guide explains how to create and use neural network-based energy functions in TorchEBM.

!!! note "Under Construction"
    This page is currently under development. Check back soon for the complete guide on neural network energy functions.

## Overview

Neural networks can be used to represent complex energy functions for energy-based models, allowing for more expressive and flexible representations.

## Basic Architecture

```python
