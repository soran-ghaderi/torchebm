# TorchEBM Guides

Welcome to the TorchEBM guides! This section provides a structured learning path to help you master Energy-Based Models with our library. We recommend following the guides in order to build a solid understanding from the ground up.

## Learning Path

1.  **[Getting Started](getting_started.md)**: Install TorchEBM and train your first model in minutes.
2.  **[Custom Neural Networks](custom_neural_networks.md)**: Learn how to use your own `torch.nn.Module` as an energy function.
3.  **[Samplers](samplers.md)**: Explore the different MCMC algorithms available for generating samples from your model.
4.  **[Loss Functions](loss_functions.md)**: Understand the various loss functions you can use to train your EBM.
5.  **[Training EBMs](training.md)**: Dive into a complete, end-to-end training pipeline with best practices.
6.  **[Visualization](visualization.md)**: Learn how to visualize energy landscapes and sample distributions to understand your model's behavior.
7.  **[Parallel Sampling](parallel_sampling.md)**: See how to leverage parallel computation to speed up sampling.

By the end of this series, you will have a comprehensive understanding of how to build, train, and analyze Energy-Based Models using TorchEBM.
